# DeepClueTest


DeepClue (get it?) is a fun side project I've been working on in my spare time. 
This repository contains the DeepClue backend and assoiciated Test suite.

DeepClue  is an electronic assistant in the board game clue. Like the paper score cards supplied in the game, 
you enter the information that you observe in the game. This takes the form of ether a player revealing a card to you, 
revealing a card to another player, or passing on a guess (meaning they do not have any of the cards in that guess).

The back end takes this information and stores it. It uses the data to make new inference about what cards belong to whom,
and alerts you when the 3 mistery cards, called the envelope are known. 

Basically it tells you when you know WHO DONE IT. I am curretnly developing the front end in Android Studio, which allows the 
user to scroll through the information and make the best guess they can baised on that information.
